#' Calculate Root Mean Square Predictive Error of a Synthetic Control Analysis
#' 
#' This function calculates the root mean square predictive error (RMSPE) of a synthetic control analysis over a user specified time period.  Predictive error refers to the gap between the treated unit's observed outcome and the synthetic control's predicted outcome.  See Abadie, Diamond, Hainmueller (2010, 2015) for the role of this statistic in the synthetic control method.
#' 
#' @usage SynthRMSPE(dataprep, synth, begin_time, end_time)
#' 
#' @param dataprep The output of a call to \code{dataprep}
#' @param synth The output of a call to \code{Synth}
#' @param begin_time A numeric giving the beginning of the period over which to calculate the RMSPE
#' @param end_time A numeric giving the end of the period over which to calculate the RMSPE
#' 
#' @return A numeric of lengthing one containing the RMSPE over the given period

#' #' Calculate Root Mean Square Predictive Errors for Multiple Synthetic Controls
#' 
#' This function calculates three statistics important for assessing the goodness of fit and significance of synthetic controls for objects containing data on several synthetic control fits, such as a \code{\link{MultiSynth}} object. It is not intended to be called directly by the user, but is instead called by \code{\link{fitMultiSynth}}.
#' 
#' @usage MultiSynthErrorRatios(MultiSynthPrep_obj, MultiSynth_obj,
#' treatment_time, input)
#' 
#'  @param MultiSynthPrep_obj A list of outputs from the dataprep function
#'  @param MultiSynth_obj A list of outputs from the synth function
#'  @param treatment_time A numeric giving the time treatment is administered
#'  @param input The output of a call to the function \code{dataprep}, containing the time periods for each of the analyses in the MultiSynthPrep_obj and MultiSynth_obj
#'  
#'  @details The three statistics implemented by this function are the pretreatment Root Mean Square Predictive Error (RMSPE), the posttreatment RMSPE, and the ratio of post- to pretreatment RMSPE.  As described in Abadie, Diamond, Hainmueller (2010, 2014), these statistics allow the reasercher to investigate both the goodness of fit and significance of synthetic control analyses. 
#'  
#' Pretreatment RMSPE measures goodness of fit in the pre-treatment period; typically, lower values imply a better fit.  Posttreatment RMSPE measures the divergence between the treated unit and the synthetic control after treatment, and in effect, measures how large the effect of treatment is.  The ratio of these two quantities combines these elements, taking on large values only when the fit is good and the effect is large.  
#' 
#' The ratios can then be used in combination with placebo analyses, as implmemented by \code{\link{fitMultiSynth}}, to determine the signifiance of a synthetic control analysis.  The logic is that placebo synthetic controls should not have large RMSPE ratios, because no treatment is administered to these units.  As such, if the treated case has a large RMSPE ratio relative to placebo cases, this serves as evidence that the treatment has had an impact on the outcome.
