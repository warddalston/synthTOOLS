\title{Calculate the Average Treatment Effect for multiple synthetic control fits at once}
\usage{
MultiSynthATE(MultiSynthPrep_obj, MultiSynth_obj,
 begin_time, end_time)
}
\arguments{
\item{MultiSynthPrep_obj}{A list of outputs from the dataprep function}

\item{MultiSynth_obj}{A list of outputs from the synth function}

\item{begin_time}{A numeric containing the beggining of the period over which to calculate the ATE}

\item{end_time}{A numeric containing the end of the period over which to calculate the ATE}
}
\value{
A named vector containing the estimated ATEs
}
\description{
This function calculates the average treatment effect (ATE) for multiple synthetic control fits.  It requires the user to provide a list of \code{\link{dataprep}} outputs and \code{\link{synth}} outputs, as well as to provide the beggining and end time periods over which to calculate the ATE.  It is not designed to be used directly by the user, by rather, is called as part of \code{\link{fitMultiSynth}}.
}
\details{
This function is called automatically by \code{\link{fitMultiSynth}}.  However, it can also be called independently.  To do this with a \code{\link{MultiSynth}} object, the user should give the "preps" slot as the first arguement, and "fits" slot as the second arguement.
